        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                Hi! Here are the three facts you should know about me: I'm impressive, awesome, and hardworking. The
                fourth fact is that I have absolutely no problem telling people the first three facts. Some call it
                self-confidence, I call it advanced personal marketing. I'm also incredibly modest - I literally just
                proved that by telling you how awesome I am with a completely straight face.
                <br><br>
                Now, let's talk about what I do and what is this boring 'about me' section. Actually, I'm what people
                call a polymath or polyhistor - which sounds way fancier than it actually is. Fun fact: I didn't even
                know these terms existed until I asked ChatGPT 'What do people call a crazy person like me who's
                obsessed with learning everything?' Turns out there's an actual word for it, and it is not a mental
                illness.
                <br><br>
                From the beginning of time—or at least when I first arrived on this place called Terra, or Gaia, or
                Tellus, or Earth (I like to keep my options open)—I grew up wondering why most people only do one thing
                or specialize in one field. It's like they picked their favorite flavor of ice cream at age 5 and
                decided that was it for life. No vanilla-chocolate-strawberry-pistachio adventures allowed!
                <br><br>
                I started realizing this even more when I went to school, where everyone focused on memorizing stuff. As
                Mark Twain wisely said, "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education" though I had my own
                version: "Don't memorize the things that you can look up!" And yeah, that great man... or idiot.. was
                none other than me.(I'm still deciding which category I fall into.)
                <br><br>
                I asked many people about what they wanted to become or what they liked to do, and guess what? Most of
                the answers were doctor, engineer, pilot, and other conventional jobs. But I had a different answer—I
                wanted to do everything that I could. I was endlessly curious and never got bored. I wanted to build
                stuff, help people, solve problems, learn new things, but I never wanted to memorize thousands of pages
                like some kind of human photo copy machine.
                <br><br>
                Apparently, this made me weird. Or as I later discovered, a "polymath"—which sounds way cooler than
                "that person who can't pick a lane." Oh, you are still reading, I think I should write a biography about
                myself, what do you think. Ok, I think this much is fine. Now, you get a clear idea who I am.
